Simple Machines is a slightly simpler mod than the other tech mods, like Mekanism and Thermal Foundation.
Simple Machines is not a replacement to the other tech mods, use other tech mods with it!

The Machinery, Automation, Power, and Pipes will be sure to help you create a factory to get all the stuff you need in your adventures (except food).

Can I use it in a modpack?

Yes you can use it a modpack as long the modpack isn't a paid modpack.
